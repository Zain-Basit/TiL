# Today I Learned

This is a website where a person can share facts they find interesting with others. They also have the ability to
vote on the facts shared by other people and this can even flag false facts. Users can select categories to share facts in as well.

## How It Works

Load the website on [https://tilfact.netlify.app/](https://tilfact.netlify.app/) and then you can press the 'Share a Fact' button.
This will open the fact sharing form which will let you enter your fact, a source, and a category to share in.

Once you've shared a fact, feel free to read through the others and then vote on them. If the fact seems to be false, you can vote
it as false with the ⛔️ icon. Otherwise you can up vote it, or indicate that your mind was blown.
